// Generic single-port synchronous-request wrapper around one of
// rtl/sdram.sv's four toggle-style req/ack ports. Hides the toggle
// protocol behind a simple pulse-in/pulse-out interface: assert `req`
// for one cycle with `addr`/`we`/`din` valid, then wait for `valid` to
// pulse with `dout` holding the read result (or, for a write, simply
// confirming the write landed — `dout` is meaningless for a write).
//
// See docs/hw-bringup.md for why every ROM region in this project's
// hardware bring-up work goes through SDRAM via one of these, rather
// than the $readmemh-loaded 0-latency arrays every sim-only core uses
// today.

	// reads sharing a port with ioctl_download's writes, see
	// tdragon2_core.sv's g_rom_hw block) could receive a `valid` pulse

	// transaction completing, not a genuine completion of its own
	// request — reading dbg_we_r_o/dbg_addr_r_o at the exact cycle
	// `valid` pulses reveals whether the transaction that just finished
	// really was the read/address the reader thinks it was. Every
	// existing instantiation leaves these unconnected — harmless no-op.
