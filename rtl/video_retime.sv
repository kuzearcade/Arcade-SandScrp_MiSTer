// Video output retimer (2026-09-11, docs/known-issues.md NMK-18).
//
// The shared Family C core draws its raster on clk_sys (40 MHz) with an
// 8 MHz pixel enable: 512 pixels per 64 us line, the hi-res boards'
// exact geometry (16 MHz/2, HTOTAL 512). Power Instinct's board runs
// 448 pixels per line at 7 MHz (14 MHz/2, set_screen_midres) — the same
// 64 us line, so every interrupt, DMA and frame is exact — but 40 MHz
// has no integer 7 MHz enable, and a fractional one (40/7) would make
// alternate pixels 125 and 150 ns wide on an analog monitor. This
// module re-clocks the picture instead: the core's pixels are written
// into a two-line buffer as they are drawn, and read back on clk_r
// (56 MHz, rtl/pll_video.v) at an exact 8 MHz (/7) or 7 MHz (/8) pixel
// rate — 3584 clk_r per line either way, the same 64 us — one line
// behind the write side, with sync/blanking regenerated here in the
// board's own pixel units (H/V Shift trims included). CLK_VIDEO/
// CE_PIXEL/VGA_* then carry the PCB's pixel clock to the framework's
// scaler and analog output.
//
// Phase: the read side free-runs on its own counters (exactly rate-
// matched, both PLLs lock to the same 50 MHz) and is placed once on the
// first synchronised write-side frame start; every later frame start is
// checked against the expected read position and only a gross error
// (> 32 clk_r, i.e. a mode change, a restart or a lost frame) reloads
// it, so the sync outputs never take a per-frame jitter step.
//
// Buffer parity is the line number's LSB on both sides (VTOTAL 278 is
// even, so the parity sequence is consistent across the frame wrap):
// line L is written into buf[L&1] during write line L and read back
// during write line L+1, while the writer fills buf[(L+1)&1].
// Parameters (2026-09-11, the Gunnail rbf): the two modes' geometry and
// the clk_r count per line are parameters — the defaults are the
// Macross2 rbf's (56 MHz clk_r: 512 px / 7 and 448 px / 8); NMK16_Gunnail.sv
// passes a 48 MHz set (512 px / 6 for gunnail, 384 px / 8 for the lowres
// boards, 3072 clk_r per line). mode1 selects the second set.
