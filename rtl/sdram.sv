	// this controller targets needs all 8192 rows refreshed within
	// 64ms (JEDEC spec), i.e. at most 64ms/8192 = 7.8125us between
	// refreshes of a given row — this parameter IS that interval,
	// expressed in `clk` cycles, so it must scale with whatever clock
	// rate `clk` actually runs at. Default (850) matches this file's
	// own original tuning, which line 80's own RASCAS_DELAY comment
	// ("2 cycles@96MHz") suggests targeted something in the ~96MHz+
	// range MiSTer's own sdram.sv is typically run at elsewhere in the
	// ecosystem — 850/96MHz=8.85us, already slightly over the 7.8125us
	// spec, but with real-world retention margin most chips have
	// beyond the strict worst-case JEDEC number. Confirmed by direct
	// real-hardware testing (a standalone SDRAM write/read-back test
	// core, see SdramTest.sv) that this default is UNSAFE at this
	// project's own 40MHz clk_sys: 850/40MHz=21.25us, a full 8192-row
	// refresh sweep of ~174ms, more than DOUBLE the 64ms spec —
	// produced real, reproducible read-back data corruption on actual
	// silicon (never visible in sim/models/sdram_model.sv, which does
	// not model DRAM charge decay at all). This project's own top
	// level(s) must override REFRESH_CYCLES for their actual clk_sys
	// rate; the default here is left as this file's own original value
	// rather than silently changed, since other MiSTer cores may

	// timing-margin hypothesis after RASCAS_DELAY alone (tRCD, the
